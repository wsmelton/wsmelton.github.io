# PowerShell Learning Path

How much do you automate in your job? The question is not necessarily specific to SQL Server, whether you work as a system administrator or even business analyst. There are areas of your job that can be, and should be, automated. Ok, now back to SQL Server specifics...

# Day-To-Day Task

A database administrator always has some mundane task to do each day, if they want to keep their job. These little things are the best candidates for automating, as a starting point. Once you get those automated you will see the benefit and it will help your mindset change to start thinking in that manner more and more.

# The Tool of Choice

One tool that is growing more and more each year in both features and use, is PowerShell. As a beginner you will ask, "what is PowerShell". I give you [this quote from The Scripting Guy](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2015/01/02/what-is-powershell/) at Microsoft that I think sums it up well:

> Windows PowerShell is an interactive object-oriented command environment with scripting language features that utilizes small programs called cmdlets to simplify configuration, administration, and management of heterogeneous environments in both standalone and networked typologies by utilizing standards-based remoting protocols.

# Learning Path

An endeavor at Pythian (my current employer) began a few months back to get folks mindset moved more toward automation. One of those paths for the teams that support Microsoft Data Platform products is PowerShell. I drew up a list of courses and books to give the team a learning path to take. Now mind you this is not an exhaustive list, just the ones I know worked for me and are well structured.

These are listed in order of progression, so if you are already familiar with certain areas you can skip over to the next.

### Introduction to PowerShell

- Total Time: 2h 41m

### PowerShell Toolmaking Fundamentals

- Total Time: 3h 55m
- Link: [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/powershell-toolmaking-fundamentals/)
- Description: PowerShell can be many things to many different people. PowerShell can be a simple command-line replacement or a scripting language. Beginners to intermediate-level scripters are probably still writing one-liners and simple scripts. They're probably starting to see the potential of PowerShell not as a simple scripting language but as a way to build "tools" to use over and over again. Don't recreate the wheel. Learn how to create reusable scripts so you don't have to recreate that wheel.

### PowerShell and SQL Server

- Total Time: 2h 48m
- Link: [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/powershell-and-sql-server/)
- Description: This course is designed to teach you the fundamentals of using PowerShell to manage your SQL Servers, as well as develop on them. In Module 1, we cover basic DBA tasks using just PowerShell. With Module 2, we provide an introduction to the two main tools for working with SQL Server, the SMO, or SQL Management Objects, and the SQL Server Provider. Module 3 will cover basic DBA tasks using both SMO and the SQL Provider. With Module 4 we switch to Developer mode and cover development using the SQL Provider. Module 5 continues the developer theme, this time using the SQL Management Objects. We finally wrap things up with Module 6, in which we go over a real world example of using PowerShell and SQL Server. We also cover the SQL PS mode of PowerShell, as well as how to make effective use of PowerShell from a SQL Server job.

### PowerShell Gotchas

- Total Time: 1h 40m
- Link: [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/powershell-gotchas/)
- Description: PowerShell is the de facto standard for automation and administration on Windows systems. The central design mantra in PowerShell is Think-Type-Get. That is: Think what you want, Type it, and Get the results. Unfortunately this mantra doesn't always work - PowerShell combines concepts from other languages (Perl, Python, and VBScript for example) and borrows ideas from other platforms (like pipelining in Bash). This creates an experience that feels familiar, but fails to behave consistently with our experiences. This creates "gotchas." In this course, we will analyze some specific cases of PowerShell's strange behavior in order to better understand how and why PowerShell works the way it does.
