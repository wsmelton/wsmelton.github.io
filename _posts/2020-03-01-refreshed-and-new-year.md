You may have noticed there is no content on this blog site now. :grin:

I decided to switch my blog back to the formal Jekyll theme. I previously used Hugo that was nice, but required to much work and could only really create content locally on my machine. Using Jekyll, as it is the default for GitHub Pages, I can use the GitHub UI for creating quick post and such.

Anyway, with a 2020 I have changed jobs and another reason to start a new with my blog is because I am no longer working full time with SQL Server and Microsoft Data Platform. I am now doing full time PowerShell development for a security software company.

My day to day is writing PowerShell code for custom integrations with the product(s) my employer has and helping customers reap the full benefits. I am also developing new PowerShell modules around the flag ship product and will be maintaining this code.
