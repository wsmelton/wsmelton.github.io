You may be aware of PowerShell supported Jupyter Notebooks as many in the community have posted about it over the past few years:

- Douge Finke's [PowerShell 101 notebooks](https://github.com/dfinke/powershell-notebooks)
- [Self published post](2020-03-09-powershell-notebooks) from March 2020
- Aaron Nelson's [PowerShell Notebooks are Available in Azure Data Studio](https://sqlvariant.com/2019/11/powershell-notebooks-are-available-in-azure-data-studio/)
- Rob Sewell's [New .NET Notebooks are here - PowerShell 7 notebooks are here](https://sqldbawithabeard.com/2020/02/07/new-net-notebooks-are-here-powershell-7-notebooks-are-here/)

These are still around with a new name and features!

## Polyglot Notebooks

Claudio Regio posted the announcement earlier this month on the 3rd that [.NET Interactive Notebooks is now Polyglot Notebooks!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-interactive-notebooks-is-now-polyglot-notebooks/)

They brought support for a ton of language kernels with a bit of rebranding and improvements that benefit us. One of the biggest things to me is the ability to mix and match kernels in a single notebook. You can create a notebook using PowerShell and for documentation mix in dynamically generating a Mermaid diagram if you wanted.

If you watched the [.NET Conf 2022](https://www.dotnetconf.net/) that occurred a few weeks ago Claudio did a great overview of using these notebooks and will give you a great starting point:

**Be sure** to check out the [magic commands](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/docs/magic-commands.md)!!!

## Setup

Open up VS Code on your machine and then install the [Polyglot Notebooks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) (it is in preview right now). Once that starts up it will prompt you to install any missing .NET/dotnet binaries.

## Magic Commands

A [magic command](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/docs/magic-commands.md) is special scriptable shortcuts that you can use to engage the power of notebooks. A few of these were shown in Claudio's session (see YouTube link above).

You can run `#!lsmagic` in a code cell within a new notebook and this will give you a list of all the current magic commands available.
