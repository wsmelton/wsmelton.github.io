## GitHub Web Editor is here!

I am actually writing this blog post using GitHub's new Web Editor experience. In this post, I'll go over what it is and how you use it.

### First - How to open it

To get the new web editor experience, you need to use the keyboard shortcuts that GitHub provides. Did you know they provide a good bit? You can open the shortcut menu that gives you the everyday use ones by using <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> to bring it up:

You can see that first one `Open in github.dev editor` by pressing the <kbd>.</kbd> (period).

### What Is It?

The short answer is a web-based version of VS Code minus most features:

It offers a next-generation experience for contributors and editors to interact with their (or other) GitHub projects via a browser.

### What does not work?

Remember, it is an editor, nothing more. You will find that many extensions in VS Code require storage and processing ability to operate, and none of those will work.

You can find by searching the marketplace while you have the web editor open and see many are not supported:

### What good is it?

Contributors can use the web editor for contributions in many ways. Number one thing maintainers love is to help fix documentation errors, and the web editor provides a significant step in making that more accessible. If you need to make a minor correction to fix your pull request or adjust code based on feedback, all of that can be done with the web editor.

Maintainers and contributors can use the web editor for doing Pull Request Reviews:

Any form of contribution is greatly appreciated, and the new web editor experience helps provide users with a more robust experience. Try it out!

You can also access any repository now with the web editor by using `github.dev` instead of `github.com` for the URL. As an example [github.dev/sqlcollaborative/dbatools](github.dev/sqlcollaborative/dbatools) will open the web editory directly.
